## Asset Custody Risk

There is documented evidence of at least one player having their entire wallet erased, including:
- cryptocurrencies
- mint-generated NFT items
- assets acquired with real funds

In NFT-based systems, acceptable controls include:
- usage restrictions
- transfer freezes
- smart-contract limitations

Complete wallet deletion represents a critical custody failure and counterparty risk.
