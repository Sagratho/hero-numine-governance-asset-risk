## Centralized Economic Control and Unbounded Supply Risk

Screenshots show in-game currency transfers executed by accounts identified as game staff (GMs).

While this does not prove malicious intent, it demonstrates that privileged accounts can inject economically convertible value.

From an NFT and Web3 perspective:
- scarcity is not verifiable
- issuance rules are opaque
- value flows are not auditable
- monetary control is centralized

If staff can inject currency at will, no in-game asset has guaranteed value.
