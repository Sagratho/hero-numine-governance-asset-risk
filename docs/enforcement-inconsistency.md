## Enforcement Inconsistency

Multiple players operated dozens of accounts simultaneously, extracted value continuously, and caused measurable economic damage.

These accounts remained active for extended periods.

In contrast, an account with:
- zero withdrawals
- no resale of items
- no token extraction

received a permanent ban.

No public enforcement criteria or proportional sanctions were communicated.
This indicates selective enforcement rather than rule-based governance.
