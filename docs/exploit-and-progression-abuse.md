## Exploit-Driven Progression Abuse

Players with multiple accounts exploited the party system to accelerate leveling far beyond intended progression.

This was compounded by a bugged skill progression system, which disproportionately favored:
- automated setups
- multi-account farming

Only after prolonged abuse did the developers disable the party system via maintenance.

By that time, a large number of artificially leveled accounts already existed, permanently distorting gameplay balance and the in-game economy.
